# ML-DL-Project1

## Machine Learning Deep Learning Project 1. Image Classification

## Steps to Test both Models

## Test Part2 Model(Hands and No hands)

1. Clone the repo or create a github codespace.
2. Add the best_model_part2.keras file to the root directory. This is the trained model that would be predicting your images.
3. Add the test image file you want to run to the root directory of the repo in 'workspaces/ML-DL-Project1'
4. run the file test_part2.py in project1 directory with `python test_part2.py `
5. The program will prompt you to enter the name of the image file you uploaded with its extension.
6. The output will be the class that the model predicts your image to be.
